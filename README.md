<h1> Welcome to my Profile :technologist: </h1>

I really like technology and I always try to research things in the area. I like to learn and understand how things work. I had the first contact with programming during my degree in Electrical Engineering at UFPI. <strong>Currently, I'm studying System Development at IFPI (technical).</strong>
My goal is to become a back-end developer. The technologies I am studying / perfecting are:
 
<ul>  
 <li>:dart: Java</li>
 <li>:dart: Python</li>
 <li>:dart: NodeJS</li>
</ul>
