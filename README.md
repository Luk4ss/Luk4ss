<h1> Welcome to my Profile :technologist: </h1>

I really like technology and I always try to research things in the area. I like to learn and understand how things work. I had the first contact with programming during my degree in Electrical Engineering at UFPI. <strong>Currently,  I'm studying System Development at IFPI (technical).</strong>
Currently, I dedicate myself daily to learn about web development to become a fullstack developer. The technologies I am studying / perfecting are:

<ul>   
  <li> HTML 5 </li>
  <li> CSS 3 </li>
  <li> JavaScript</li>
  <li> NodeJS </li>
  <li> VueJs </li>
  <li> ReactJS </li>
  <li> TailwindCSS </li>
  <li> MySQL </li>
</ul>


Today, I'm fulltime focusing on learning this technologies. :dart:
